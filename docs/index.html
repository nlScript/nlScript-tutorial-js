<h1>nlScript tutorial for JavaScript</h1>


<h2>Tutorial 01 <a target="_blank" href="tutorial01.html">(link)</a></h2>



<p>This is a basic example how nlScript works in principle. It demonstrates the three steps involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a parser
<li>Teach the parser the sentences to accept
<li>Show a dedicated editor with autocompletion adjusted to the defined language
</ul>

<p>Please note that the 2nd argument to 'defineSentence' is undefined, so that nothing actually happens when the user clicks on the editor's Run button.</p>

<p>This will be addressed in Tutorial02</p>


<h2>Tutorial 02 <a target="_blank" href="tutorial02.html">(link)</a></h2>
<p>Tutorial02 extends the previous one by specifying a 2nd parameter to
'defineSentence', an object of type Evaluator. Evaluator is an interface with a
single function evaluate(), which is called upon parsing the corresponding sentence.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i></br>
The Evaluator can be specified more concisely using a lambda expression. Here, an anonymous
class is used to be explicit on the types.</p>


<h2>Tutorial 03 <a target="_blank" href="tutorial03.html">(link)</a></h2>
<p>Tutorial03 introduces custom types.</p>

<p>Custom types are specified similar to sentences, but</p>
<ul>
<li>an explicit type name is given</li>
<li>their evaluator typically doesn't return null, but an arbitrary Java object representing that type</li>
</ul>

<p>In this particular example, using a custom type for the filter size doesn't provide any advantage. In general, one
would use custom types to</p>
<ul>
<li>reuse them in multiple sentences or other types</li>
<li>to fine-tune the way they are auto-completed in the editor.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be demonstrated in subsequent tutorials.</p>




<h2>Tutorial 04 <a target="_blank" href="tutorial04.html">(link)</a></h2>
<p>The previous tutorial introduced custom types.</br>
In Tutorial04, they will be used to change how they are autocompleted in the editor.</p>



<h2>Tutorial 05 <a target="_blank" href="tutorial05.html">(link)</a></h2>
<p>Tutorial05 demonstrates how to provide multiple definitions for a type. The type 'units' is first
defined as the string literal "pixel(s)" and additionally as "calibrated units".</p>

<p>As a result, once the user hits the corresponding position during input, an autocompletion menu will be
displayed to select between the two.</p>



<h2>Tutorial 06 <a target="_blank" href="tutorial06.html">(link)</a></h2>
<p>Tutorial06 shows how to use a fully custom Autocompleter, with the goal to replace the
static "calibrated units" option for the "units" type with the actual units string of
the currently open image.</p>

<p>There is one (autocompletion) issue here, which will be addressed in the next tutorial:
Once the user starts typing the text for the unit (let's say a 'p' for 'pixel(s)'), completion
should stop (or even better, only suggest 'pixel(s)', because 'mm' doesn't start with 'p').
However, here it will just continue to suggest 'pixel(s)' as well as 'mm'.</p>



<h2>Tutorial 07 <a target="_blank" href="tutorial07.html">(link)</a></h2>
<p>The previous tutorial showed how to use a custom Autocompleter, but suffered from one
autocompletion issue:</p>

<p>Once the user starts typing the text for the unit (let's say a 'p' for 'pixel(s)'), completion
should stop (or even better, only suggest 'pixel(s)', because 'mm' doesn't start with 'p').
However, here it will just continue to suggest 'pixel(s)' as well as 'mm'.</p>

<p>This tutorial demonstrates how to stop autocompletion once the user started typing a value.</p>

<p>In the case here, it would actually be better to filter suggested options according to what the user typed,
(and this will be shown in the next tutorial), but there are cases where stopping auto-completion after the
user started to type is important: This is particularly the case if e.g. entering numbers: As long as nothing
is entered, auto-completion should indicate what needs to be entered (e.g. a placeholder with a name), but once
the user started typing a number, auto-completion should be quiet. BTW: This is not only true for numbers, but
for also e.g. when entering a name for something.</p>



<h2>Tutorial 08 <a target="_blank" href="tutorial08.html">(link)</a></h2>
<p>The previous tutorial showed how to use a custom Autocompleter. Using a ParseStartListener, the pixel
calibration unit string is saved. The 'units' autocompleter then suggests the two options 'pixel(s)'
and the actual calibration unit string.</p>

<p>A much better solution would be, if the 'units' type could be defined as 'pixel(s)' and as 'mm' in the
first place (similar to Tutorial05), and this would work here because the image to be processed is fixed.</p>

<p>However, in a more general case, the designed language should work on any image, and therefore, at the
time of designing the language the actual pixel units are not known yet, and this is why Tutorial05
used the fixed literal 'calibrated units' instead of the actual units string.</p>

<p>This tutorial shows how the 'units' type can be re-defined dynamically, and this is again best done
within in the ParseStartListener's parsingStarted() function.</p>

<p>The result will be similar to that of Tutorial05, but instead of the general 'calibrated units'
autocompletion option, the actual units string will be shown as an option.</p>



<h2>Tutorial 09 <a target="_blank" href="tutorial09.html">(link)</a></h2>
<p>This tutorial extends the previous functionality by median filtering, background subtraction and intensity
normalization, simply by adding more sentence definitions similar to the existing one for Gaussian blurring.</p>

<p>The new sentences also re-use the 'filter-size' type.</p>

<h2>Applications <a target="_blank" href="applications.html">(link)</a></h2>
<p>Some sample applications, together with source code.</p>
